### v0.2.2-beta - More Generous Recipes

Patch notes:

- Crafting recipes are slightly more generous, to facilitate easier construction of rail infrastructure.
    - Note that this is done to accommodate various terrain generation mods which often increase the scale and distance of the world.
    - Recipes will continue to be tweaked based on user feedback.
- Moved all rail segments to the Ingredients tab in the creative menu, from the Redstone tab.

A manual/guide with crafting recipes, details on how to use the mod, and other information will be added in the next version, v0.2.2-beta. Integration with JEI to come in a future update.

### Previous version v0.2.1-beta - New Mod Logo

Patch notes:

- Added mod logo

### Previous version v0.2.0-beta - New Rails and Bug Fixes

Patch notes:

- Added Class 5 High Speed Rail (`elliesrailmod:powered_rail_class_5h`), with a top speed of 240 km/h
- Major revisions to most rail textures
    - Removed the "built-in" third rail texture from powered rails and track circuits
    - Powered rails which lack power now display prominent yellow stripes for easier identification
    - Removed the background texture for the concrete/steel base the Linear Induction Rails rest on (this is how they are in real life, but the intent with this change for the mod is to have only the rails themselves as part of the texture, and the real-life concrete/steel base as a separate block below the rails).
- Powered rails now accept power from electrification blocks (wires and generators) (in the last version (v0.1.0-beta), power was erroneously only accepted from redstone wires/torches, behaving like vanilla Powered Rails)
- Removed debug output info for Class 5 Powered Rails which was accidentally left there in the last version (v0.1.0-beta)

A manual/guide with crafting recipes, details on how to use the mod, and other information will be added in the next version, v0.2.1-beta. Integration with JEI to come in a future update.
