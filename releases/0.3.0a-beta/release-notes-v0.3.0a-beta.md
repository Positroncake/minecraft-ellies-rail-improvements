### Previous version v0.2.2-beta - More Generous Recipes

Patch notes:

- Crafting recipes are slightly more generous, to facilitate easier construction of rail infrastructure.
    - Note that this is done to accommodate various terrain generation mods which often increase the scale and distance of the world.
    - Recipes will continue to be tweaked based on user feedback.
- Moved all rail segments to the Ingredients tab in the creative menu, from the Redstone tab.

A manual/guide with crafting recipes, details on how to use the mod, and other information will be added in the next version, v0.2.3-beta. Integration with JEI to come in a future update.
