- Controllable switches
- Dynamic speed limits based on weather and minecart type
- Train signalling systems ranging from basic block signalling to precise ATP
- Different electrification standards
- Custom 3D block models for rails, electrification, and more
- and other quality-of-life improvements (e.g. set points for dismounting minecarts at stations)

Manual containing crafting recipes and details will be included in the next release, v0.2.3-beta.
