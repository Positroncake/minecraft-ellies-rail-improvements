### Ellie's Rail Improvements - v0.1.0-beta

The initial beta release of Ellie's Rail Improvements, a mod designed to improve upon the default minecart experience in Minecraft by adding various features including:

- Different classes of track (supporting different speeds) including linear induction motors
- Controllable switches
- Dynamic speed limits based on weather and minecart type
- Train signalling systems ranging from basic block signalling to precise ATP
- Different electrification standards
- Custom 3D block models for rails, electrification, and more
- and other quality-of-life improvements (e.g. set points for dismounting minecarts at stations)

Manual containing crafting recipes and details will be included in the next release, v0.3.0-beta.
